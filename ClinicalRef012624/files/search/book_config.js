Collaborative agreements detail oversight requirements such as  scope of practice, protocol documentation, physician communication and availability,  chart audits, the maximum number of APCs a physician can oversee, and more.    There are two interrelated components of APC oversight:        1. Formal oversight requirements dictated by each state’s collaborative agreement           and        2. Performance review activities (e.g., one-to-ones, performance feedback,           quarterly reviews).    Team assignments can vary based upon staffing changes and those affected by CPA  (Collaborative Practice Agreements). The goal is to match the provider with the  physician oversight that aligns best with CPA and market divisions. Current team  assignments can be found in the LM1 Team Directory.    Attention – Licensing Information    It is ESPECIALLY important that if a state requires CPA to be entered into their  system that the APC handles their portion of this requirement. Many states only  require the APC to enter their CPA information and not the physicians. It is the APCs  responsibility to know their license status.    Providers are responsible for understanding and managing the requirements of their  market or state’s collaborative agreements where applicable (e.g. ensure chart audit  requirements are met).    The AMDs have been tasked with checking on license statuses, so may contact the  APCs to provide background on lapsed licenses. In addition, AMDs often serve as  collaborating physicians for their assigned APCs. It is the APC’s responsibility to  terminate collaborative practice agreements with each respective board upon  terminating with Landmark.     Attention – Terminating CPAs     It is the APC’s responsibility to terminate collaborative practice agreements with each   respective board upon terminating with Landmark.                                                                                              4","Credentialling, Licensing, & Metrics  Proprietary & Confidential    Last Updated: 1/26/2024               Published by LM1 Training    State Licensure & Health Plan Credentialing     Attention – Responsibility of State Licensure   The provider is responsible for their own licensure and meeting each state's CME /   CEU requirements.

The call should be escalated to an advanced clinician. If an APC is not           immediately available, the call should be sent as an email triage.    11:00 PM – 7:00 AM (Local Time)        1. The call should be escalated to a working LM1 APC.        2. If there is no LM1 APC available, the Triage RN should email that LM1 APC with           the patient’s information and concern.                 o Tag the LM1 APC in Teams.      3. If there are no LM1 APCs currently working who are licensed in the patient’s             market, the Triage RN will send an email to LM1RTriage@landmarkhealth.org for           next-day follow-up.        4.

Many of these calls are requests for patient education or updates for their  care team.        1. The Triage RN will provide education, as needed, based on the Clear Triage           education guidance and their own skill set.        2. Include any education provided or updates for the Care Team in a Ubiquity note.    Example – Clear Triage Urgent Escalate to Clinician Disposition     Refer to OB    Occasionally, Landmark will have patients that are pregnant. When this occurs, the  “Refer to OB” disposition may be shown.        1. If the patient has an established OB, advise them to call their OB for further           assistance. Record the OB’s name and contact information in your Ubiquity note,           if known.        2. If the patient does not have an OB, transfer the patient to the appropriate           escalated clinician following the “Urgent Escalate to Clinician” process.    Example – Clear Triage Urgent Escalate to Clinician Disposition                                                                     62","Triage RN Workflows & Resources  Proprietary & Confidential    Last Updated: 1/26/2024          Published by LM1 Training     HHC    This disposition is for calls with complaints regarding Home Health Care issues.        1. If the patient has an established Home Health Care agency, they should be           instructed to call the agency for further assistance.                o Please record the name of the company, if known, in your Ubiquity note.        2. If the patient does not have a Home Health Care agency established, follow the           “Non-Urgent Escalate to Clinician” process.     Refer to Hospice    This disposition should not be used often:        • Patients enrolled in Hospice are disengaged from Landmark services.               o As a result, patients who contact us with questions or concerns should be                    referred back to their hospice agency.               o If there is any doubt concerning a patient’s eligibility or engagement in                    Landmark services, transfer the patient using the “Urgent Escalate to                    Clinician” call flow.    Care Advice:    The Care Advice tab includes instructions and handouts to be given to the patient and/or  caregiver.        • If you select handouts the RN will have the option to send them via email.                                                                                              63","Triage RN Workflows & Resources  Proprietary & Confidential    Last Updated: 1/26/2024          Published by LM1 Training    Documenting with Clear Triage:      1.

Documentation Guidelines:        • Use the Clear Triage system primarily to document during the call.      • After you have completed the call, use the “Copy” button within the Clear Triage             system to copy any information you noted during the call.      • Paste your Clear Triage documentation into a Ubiquity note created in the HPI             section.      • Complete the remainder of Ubiquity documentation according to existing             practice.  As part of the Quality Assurance processes at Landmark First, charts will be randomly  selected for audit to ensure compliance with policy.        • Please note that, as company policies are updated, or if greater compliance           guidelines change, the quality assurance process may be updated.    Downtime:  When Clear Triage is not available due to system issues, the Triage RN is expected to  USE THEIR BEST MEDICAL JUDGEMENT and LM1 hashtag to guide the  conversation and reach out to an LM1APC or physician for support.         • The Triage RN should err on the side of escalating patient complaints to an            advanced clinician when able to refer a higher level of care.         • Documentation of the call should specifically note that Clear Triage was            unavailable due to system issues.         • When Clear Triage becomes unavailable, the Triage RN MUST notify the            available Lead Supervisor of the downtime.         • The Lead Supervisor will notify the Clinical Leadership team if the outage is            expected to last longer than two (2) hours.                                                                                                                       64","Triage RN Workflows & Resources  Proprietary & Confidential    Last Updated: 1/26/2024          Published by LM1 Training    Triage RN Call Determinations    1.

Do I need to create multiple notes if I complete multiple contacts for the           same patient in one day?             No, you should continue to combine all contacts associated with the same patient           in a day into one note as long as you check the correct tags / note types.        2. If I complete multiple meaningful contacts with a patient in one day, do they           count as multiple touches?             No, only one note per patient will count towards the touch logic per day           (regardless of the number of tags).        3. Do contacts with community providers, PCP or specialist count as           meaningful touches?             No. Although theses external contacts are critical for taking care of our patients, they are           considered a part of case management and do not count as meaningful patient touches.        4. Do reminder calls count as meaningful touches?                 • A pure reminder call to a patient is not considered a meaningful touch.                 • A pure reminder call should be documented using the                    “Reminder/confirmation call” tag (but not the “Meaningful Touch” tag).                 • However, if you had a substantial and meaningful conversation with the                    patient or family/friend about care in addition to the upcoming visit                    reminder, this contact would count as a meaningful touch.                        o Please use the “Meaningful Touch” tag along with any other tags                             that reflect your contact (flu education, tuck in call, care plan                             updated, referral, etc.).                                                109","Charting, Labs, Imaging, & Medication Data  Proprietary & Confidential    Last Updated: 1/26/2024                     Published by LM1 Training    Offline Documentation    Documentation MUST be completed for every call regarding our patients.

Attention – Assessing Patient Need    If you feel that an order needs to be completed STAT, the patient likely needs to be  seen in urgent care or ER.    Diagnostics:        • In-home diagnostics are very poor quality.        • In-home imaging may not be available due to geography and / or the number of           steps into the patient’s home (cannot be more than 3 or 4 depending on the           company).        • If not emergent and the patient is able to ambulate, consider sending an order to           the local imaging center.        • If diagnostics indicated:                 o Coordination with the market is necessary.

In general, orders must be entered into Ubiquity as a “task” for the UE and  acknowledged by the UE in Ubiquity prior to implementation.     Attention – Use of Verbal Order Procedure          • In rare circumstances, real-time order entry and confirmation may not be            available. In this situation, the provider and UE should follow the “Verbal            Orders” procedure.    Verbal Orders (when unable to enter a task):    1. The UE will write orders down in a field notebook / Ubiquity note, and then      verbally repeat each order back to the issuing provider to verify the order(s) was /      were received correctly read back using the following nomenclature:    o Date & time    o Verbal order    o Provider name & credentials giving verbal orders.    o UE name and credentials receiving verbal orders.    2. The provider will clarify any orders not understood as intended, the UE will again      repeat the process of confirming the order until both UE and Provider agree.    3. The Landmark APC will document their orders in the Ubiquity Provider      Documentation Section for the UV.    4. The Landmark APP will then copy and paste the order from Ubiquity into    Microsoft Teams, directed to the UE.    5. The UE will verify that the order          Example – #UEVORB Note      documented in Teams matches the      verbal order just given.

The procedure is specifically designed to catch errors  such as:        • Wrong drug (visual slip or mistake – skill-based error).      • Wrong dose (mistake – skill, rule, or knowledge-based error).      • Wrong concentration (slip – skill or rule-based error).      • Wrong volume to be administered (calculation – knowledge-based error).      • Wrong duration of administration (rule-based error).      • Wrong situation or reason for administration (contextual, rule-based error).      • Absolute and relative contraindications including known patient drug allergies,             potential interactions, expired medication (contextual error – rule-based error).    Procedure:        1. After correctly verifying the medication order per the previous section, the UE           then prepares to administer the medication.        2. The Cross Check should be accomplished ideally via video. In rare           circumstances it can be accomplished via telephone. The expectation is, in most           circumstances, that a photograph of the medication packaging is sent to the           provider. This photograph may be reviewed after administration if technology will           not permit its real-time transmission.        3. This procedure should ideally be conducted in a “sterile cockpit” approach.           Explain to other people on scene that this needs to be accomplished without           interruption or distraction.        4. UE verbalizes to the APC, “Cross Check”.                                                                                                                     158","Urgent Calls + UEUV Workflows  Proprietary & Confidential    Last Updated: 1/26/2024        Published by LM1 Training    5. APC verbalizes “Ready” when they are ready to cross check.    6. UE verbalizes “I am going to give: Drug, Dose, Route, Rate, Reason.”    7. APC checks that this reflects the order. If it matches, asks the UE      “Contraindications?”    8. If none, the UE states “No contraindications.” If there are contraindications, the      contraindication is discussed between providers. a. Contraindications refers to      verifying appropriate vital signs, patient allergies, expiration date of medication.    9. APC asks “Volume?” (or Quantity?” for PO medications)    10. UE states:          o Drug name        o Drug concentration        o Volume to be administered in milliliters (do not state “amp” or “vial”); or if PO               the number of tablets.        o The UE then shows the medication label to the APC along with the syringe               with medication.        o The UE can “show” the medication by taking a picture and transmitting it, or               by video.    11. APC verifies the information and if correct states “Sounds good, give it; go      ahead; etc.)    12. If at any point there is a discrepancy, disagreement, or need for clarification, it      must be resolved before continuing the cross check.    13. The MACC must be completed prior to administration of any medication.    14. Restart the MACC process if it is interrupted at any point.    15. Avoid ambiguous statements like “okay”.    16. Be cognizant of Red Flags of Lost Situational Awareness:          o Intuition or a “bad gut feeling”        o Rushing        o Poor communication or Ambiguity        o Disagreement or Confusion        o Task saturation        o Trying something new under pressure        o Interruptions        o Preoccupation                                   159","Urgent Calls + UEUV Workflows  Proprietary & Confidential    Last Updated: 1/26/2024        Published by LM1 Training    MACC Visual Outline:       • “Contraindicators” include:              o Verification of appropriate vital signs.              o Known Patient Allergies              o Expiration Date       • If there is a discrepancy, disagreement, or need for clarification at any time:              o It must be resolved before continuing the Cross Check.       • Only an APC and authorize the administration of medication.     • The MACC must be completed prior to the administration of any medication.

When we are asked to refill a patient’s medication, the following  factors should be considered:        • Was the patient’s medication lost or stolen?        • Has the patient been misusing or abusing their medication?        • Are there noncompliance issues to consider?        • Is the patient able to reach their Primary Care Provider or having issues           communicating with their pharmacy?        • Refilling a medication will require an EOC to be opened, thus an Encounter must           be created. This will notify the care team to follow up.    Refill Guidelines:        • For patients out of medications, provide a bridge of 2-4 days (or rarely a full refill)           of critical med Rx.        • Attempts should be made to have the last prescribing provider refill, especially           during normal business hours.                 o Landmark First APCs do not work M-F 8-5 schedules and will not receive                    subsequent refill requests in a timely manner.    Behavioral Health Medication:    Attempt to coordinate care with BH provider as you would with any other medication.  Bridge only, and episode of care follow-up should include a focus on ensuring  appropriate BH care and identifying and barriers to management.    Attention – Scheduled Medications    Landmark First cannot refill any scheduled medications.      • This includes Lyrica and gabapentin.                                                                                         174","Urgent Calls + UEUV Workflows                               Proprietary & Confidential    Last Updated: 1/26/2024                                     Published by LM1 Training    Patient Refuses ED Referral Workflow    Consider using the “#LM1Refusal” hashtag:     Examples – #LM1Refusal Hashtag Text     I have discussed the risks, benefits, and alternatives to emergent/urgent evaluation in   the ED/Urgent Care/PMD office, with recommendations to call 911.
